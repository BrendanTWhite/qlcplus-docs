A Label is simply text field that can be placed on the Virtual Console to give additional information, for example, as a heading for a group of buttons or the title of a frame.

### Configuration

You can only set up the text to be displayed in a Label with the **Rename** ![](/basics/editclear.png) button. It does not have any other purpose nor configurable options, other than the standard [styling & placement options](../styling-and-placement) that all Virtual Console widgets have.
