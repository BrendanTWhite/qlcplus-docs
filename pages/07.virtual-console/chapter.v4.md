# Virtual Console

The purpose of the Virtual Console is to act as a blank canvas on which the user can create a lighting desk layout of his choice. Users can place various GUI (Graphical User Interface) elements, called widgets, onto the console surface:

* Buttons for starting and stopping functions
* Sliders for adjusting channel values or function intensity
* Speed dials for adjusting function speeds
* XY Pads for manually moving intelligent light beams
* Cue lists for theatrical performance purposes
* Frames for grouping various widgets together
* Solo Frames for keeping only one button/function active at a time
* Labels to act as static information banners for other widgets

The topmost part of the Virtual Console is dedicated to a tool bar that provides quick access to the most common actions: adding new widgets, copying them to/from the clipboard, configuring the widgets and, in case of emergencies, a panic button for stopping all currently running functions.

Each Virtual Console widget's style can be configured (to some extent). Widgets can be moved anywhere and resized to any size on the Virtual Console canvas. See the article on [Virtual Console Widget Styling & Placement](styling-and-placement).
