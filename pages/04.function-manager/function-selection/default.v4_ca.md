Whenever a [Function](/basics/glossary-and-concepts#functions) needs to be selected, for example when you're adding steps to a [Chaser](/basics/glossary-and-concepts#chaser), using the [Chaser Editor](../chaser-editor), the **Select Function** dialog is used.

Sometimes the destination that you are selecting the function for might allow the selection of multiple functions, for example, when adding steps to a Chaser or functions to a Collection. In these cases, the order in which the functions are selected will also be the order in which they are added to their destination. On the other hand, when attaching a function to a button in the [Virtual Console](/virtual-console), you may select only one function at a time.

Refer to your operating system manual for documentation on how to select multiple items in a list.

| **Functions to display** | There are two radio buttons on the top of the window: **All functions** and **Running functions**.  <br>By clicking on them, the list below will be filled only with the desired functions.  <br>For example, when performing a [Live edit](/main-window/live-edit), you might want to display only the running functions.  <br>Obviously, in design mode, selecting "Running functions" will show an empty list. |
| **Function list** | * Name: The names of available functions<br>* Type: The type of each of the available functions |
