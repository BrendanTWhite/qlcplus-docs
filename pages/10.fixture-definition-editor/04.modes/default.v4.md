| ![](/basics/edit_remove.png) | Remove the currently selected mode from the fixture. Removing a mode does not destroy any channels or other modes. |
| ![](/basics/edit.png) | Edit the currently selected mode, using the [Mode Editor](#mode-editor). |
| ![](/basics/editcopy.png) | Create a copy of the currently selected mode to the same fixture. Since modes are tightly coupled to a certain fixture's channels, modes cannot be copied across fixtures. |
